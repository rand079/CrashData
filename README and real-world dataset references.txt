Within this folder, we include files to support the submission of our paper, Classifying imbalanced road accident data using recurring concept drift to CIKM 2019.

Included are two real-world datasets, the NZ Crash and UK Crash binary class problems described in the paper. Other real-world datasets can be found at the following locations:

- ClickP is from the KDD Cup 2012 and can be found here https://www.openml.org/d/1219
- The PAKDD 2009 dataset is avialble from http://www.cs.put.poznan.pl/dbrzezinski/software.php.
- Elec is available from the MOA website https://moa.cms.waikato.ac.nz/datasets/2013/
- Weather is available from the repository referenced in: Ditzler, Gregory, and Robi Polikar. "Incremental learning of concept drift from streaming imbalanced data." IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering 25.10 (2012): 2283-2301.

MOA classes are included in this folder for the GAD and GCPF approaches described.
